# LineSweep
Created efficient and streamlined code to help determine intersection points on graph using Java TreeMap and point class in NLogN time and O(n) space. 
Scanner class was used to determine input. 
Input sample: 4 2 1 6 1 4 0 1 5 5 6 5 5 2 7 1 3
First number indicates number of lines followed by start and end points (x,y) of each line. Output will be the points of intersection
